Years old, I saw a magnificent picture in a book called True Stories from Nature about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
Here is a copy of the drawing.
In the book, it said.
Boa constrictors swallow their prey hole without chewing it.
After that they are not able to move and they sleep through the six month that they need for digestion.
I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.
And after some work with a colored pencil, I succeeded in making my first drawing.
My drawing #1.
It looked like this.
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
But they answered.
Frightened. Why should anyone be frightened by heart?
