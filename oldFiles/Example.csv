make sure the people in Florida get everything they need
"to fully, thoroughly recover,” Biden said in this"
southwestern Florida community that bore the brunt of
Ian’s assault.
"“It’s going to take a hell of a long time, hopefully without"
"any snags in the way,” he said. “Later, after the television"
"cameras have moved on, we’re still going to be here with"
you.”
"Earlier, DeSantis and his wife Casey greeted the president"
and first lady Jill Biden as they arrived at Fisherman’s
"Wharf, where homes and business lay in ruins amid debris"
and muck after Hurricane Ian tore through last week.
Biden and DeSantis spoke by themselves next to a boat
"the storm had lifted into a cafe, then moved separately"
among local residents hit hard by the hurricane. Biden
embraced one woman.
The scope of the devastation was immense. Biden’s
"motorcade drove by wind-shorn trees, some uprooted,"
others with branches pulled backwards by the storm.
"Fields off the highway were still flooded, forming stagnant"
lagoons.
